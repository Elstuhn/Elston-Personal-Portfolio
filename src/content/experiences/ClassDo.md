- I've been working as an Intern here since 1st Nov 2021

- I've done ad-hoc tasks such as making a program to web-scrape multiple websites and importing the information into an excel sheet

- I've also done tutorial videos, help centre articles and tech support, helping users out with whatever problem they may have

- Through this experience, I learnt how truly important accountability and communication is
